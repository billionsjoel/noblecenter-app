            <h4>Advocacy</h4>
            <div class="service-info">
                <p>Many times, individual and community behavior change isn’t enough to overcome barriers to desired
                    changes. Sometimes the system is the greater barrier. That’s why advocacy is a critical piece of our
                    work.
                    Part of creating sustainable change often involves winning the backing of decision-makers,
                    policymakers and others who can commit the resources, enact the necessary policies to support good
                    behavior practices or remove structural hurdles standing in the way. The advocacy tools we use focus
                    on identifying the right decision-makers and presenting them with a doable ask, using a systematic
                    approach to ensure change happens. Achieving lasting change with advocacy is just another example of
                    what behavior change can accomplish.
