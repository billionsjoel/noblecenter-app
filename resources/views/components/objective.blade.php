                </h5>
                <p>Social and Behavior Change (SBC) is the process of applying research and theory - based
                    approaches to
                    identify opportunities to change behaviors at the individual, community, and/or societal levels.

                <h6 class="text-blue">WHY SOCIAL AND BEHAVIOR CHANGE?</h6>

                <p> Human behavior is complex - a combination of influences is often necessary to trigger a person
                    to
                    test, adopt and sustain new behaviors.

                    The vast majority of development interventions have one thing in common: their goals can be
                    achieved
                    only if the target groups start practicing new behaviors.

                    Many development interventions fail because they are based on incorrect assumptions why people
                    do
                    not practice the promoted behaviors.

                    Understanding exactly which factors prevent people from practicing the promoted behaviors and
                    subsequently addressing the identified barriers is the single most effective way to achieve the
                    desired behavior.</p>
