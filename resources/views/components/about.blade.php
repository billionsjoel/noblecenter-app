            <p>Noble Center for Behavior Change (NCBC) is a professional organization in Uganda (Limited by
                Guarantee), that was founded and incorporated in 2021. We specialize in the design of social and
                behavior change projects and programs. We join forces with governments, NGOs, policy makers,
                researchers, charities and businesses to build a world where lives of people and communities are
                positively changed and transformed. We use our skills to address challenges in many areas such as:
                Education and literacy; Environment and nature conservation; Health sector; Women and youth
                development programs; Tourism and wildlife conservation; Children’s rights and protection; Economic
                development initiatives; Agriculture, livestock and fishing industry; Eradicating social problems; Food
                security and nutrition; Empowering vulnerable groups of people in society; to mention but a few.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Center applies the art and science of social and behavior change, to address key challenges facing
                society today with an approach that promotes and facilitates changes in attitudes, knowledge, norms,
                values, beliefs and behaviors.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our mission requires rein enforcing positive behaviors and supporting social change. It is not easy. We
                have learned that before you collaborate with communities, it helps to understand the day to day
                realities,
                what matters most to them, what mobilizes them, what makes them feel connected, how do cultural
                economic and institutional factors influence their choices. These are questions our Center, as Social
                and
                Behavior Change experts, help address and the answers are critical to improving lives.

            <p>
                Whether you want people to stop polluting fresh water bodies; to end child marriages in society;
                encourage farmers to adopt new innovative and sustainable farming practices; encourage people living
                with cancer to stay positive minded and active; stop communities from encroaching on wetlands and
                preserve the environment - You’re asking people to ‘do’ something – buy this, do this, go there, know
                this, stop that - and that is all behavior change.</p>
            <p>
                Understanding and inspiring lasting behavior change demands more than slogans and posters. It demands
                actively engaging with communities, studying how people communicate and influence each other;
                developing programs that positively shift social norms, attitudes, knowledge, beliefs and barriers;
                designing policies, products and services with local insights to meet local needs and defining what
                success looks like together with each community we partner with. This approach of social and behavior
                change has a history of success and it gives under-served communities a voice and helps them create a
                long term measurable change.</p>
            <p>
                Now more than ever, doing without the expertise of social and behavior change can cost lives, as well as
                lead to the failure and huge waste of valuable resources for many well-intended interventions in various
                sectors.</p>
            <p>
                When seeking to change behaviors, we technically use theories and models as a guide. Several behavior
                change theories help to explain human behavior and assist in identifying effective actions that will
                address given problems as well as guide the design and implementation of evidence‐based programs. That
                is where we come in and offer a solution.</p>
            <p>
                Our approach to influencing behaviors is based on a deep understanding of our target audiences,
                employing a systematic process beginning with formative research. We do not prescribe the solution
                before we have done our research. Too often interventions are rolled out without understanding the
                audience situation analysis. It is these incorrect assumptions alongside unrealistic expectations that
                are
                among the main reason, many projects fail. Therefore, by providing our behavior change expertise from
                the research stage all the way to the designing, implementation and evaluation of the intervention, we
                will
                definitely deliver measurable outcomes and a lasting impact.</p>
            <p>
                We follow a planned process that consists of five steps which include: 1. Understanding the behavioral
                problem through situation and target audience analysis; 2. Focusing and designing the social behavior
                change strategy and interventions; 3. Creating intervention messages, materials and the dissemination
                plan; 4. Implementing and monitoring the activities; 5. Evaluating and re-planning for improved
                outcomes and sustainability.</p>
            <p>
                Important to note is that each phase above is a cost center. Additionally, there is no one-size-fits-all
                strategy. Every situation is unique. We will explore your situation with you and design a scope of work.
                We work with clients, stakeholders and communities to develop cost-effective solutions to behavioral
                challenges.</p>
            <p>
                Our Center integrates best practices from disciplines such as; social psychology, communications,
                sociology, community development, social marketing, behavioral sciences, among others.
