                <h4>Health Sector</h4>
                <div class="focus-content">
                    <p>In Uganda and abroad, governments face multiple health challenges. These may include:
                        Tuberculosis,
                        Sexually Transmitted Diseases, HIV/AIDS and other contagious diseases that raise global health
                        security concerns; Heart disease; Cancer; Drug abuse; Mental health; to mention but a few. Our
                        Center researches into what causes these persistent health problems and delivers social and
                        behavior
                        change research-based, systems-focused and digital solutions. We work with private and public
                        providers to ensure access to quality care for medical issues ranging from reproductive and
                        maternal
                        health to malaria to family planning. Our one goal: improving people’s health.</p>

                    <div class="focus-content">
                        Regarding advancing workers, families and the economy, Noble Center for Behavior Change conducts
                        groundbreaking research and provides technical assistance to support work and family well-being
                        in society. Our social and behavior change technical assistance help people gain skills for
                        family-sustaining jobs, strengthen the healthcare workforce, increase employment for those with
                        disabilities and improve cash assistance and social insurance. To achieve inclusive economic
                        growth, we focus on small business financial services, youth and women’s economic empowerment as
                        well as the promotion of trade and investment.

                    <h4>Gender Equality</h4>
                    <div class="focus-content">
                        Gender inequality continues to place burdens on the impact of various development interventions.
                        Both men and women have unique roles to play to improve the status within their households and
                        communities. Our gender-sensitive programming interventions are behavior-centered approaches
                        that identify, consider, and account for the different needs, abilities, and opportunities of
                        women, men, girls, and boys to facilitate individuals, households, groups, and communities to
                        adopt and sustain evidence-based practices as well as transform the environment within which
                        behavior change occurs. <br />
                        Expanding the scope of behavior change interventions to address social and structural factors,
                        including gender norms and inequalities, is increasingly considered a best practice and evidence
                        suggests it leads to improved outcomes for interventions across sectors spanning; health,
                        agriculture, food security, economic empowerment, among others.

                    <div class="focus-content">
                        From reports in this sector, a lot of progress has been achieved, however, various challenges
                        still persist. For instance, lack of qualified personnel: Most of the caregivers handling
                        children in pre-primary schools are not qualified yet it is the most critical stage at which the
                        human brain is developed to over 90% of its adult weight. This contributes to the effects of
                        poor performance at the higher levels of education.
                        High absenteeism among teachers and learners; Lack of mid-day meals in primary institutions;
                        among others. To achieve behavior change, there is a need to switch from giving information
                        (awareness) to facilitating changing practices.

                    <h4>Water Security, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) and Water Resources Management (WRM)</h4>
                    <div class="focus-content">
                        Within this sector, a focus on behavior is as important as the technical and infrastructure
                        choices in achieving program objectives. We develop effective, evidence-based social and
                        behavior change programming to achieve water security, sanitation, and hygiene development
                        objectives using holistic approaches that include a suite of activities, including structural
                        and communication interventions, to increase the likelihood of sustained change.
                        <br />A list of key behaviors that could be addressed with WASH and WRM programs include:

                    <h4>Emergency Preparedness, Response and Recovery</h4>
                    <div class="focus-content">
                        <p>Emergencies are acute events that characteristically take populations by surprise and, most
                            likely, spread fear and anxiety. Examples of emergencies include natural disasters such as
                            earthquakes, floods, droughts etc.
                            During emergencies, a coordinated, clear and credible strategy aids in minimizing resulting
                            health, social and economic costs. However, the uncertainty that characterizes emergencies
                            typically fuels fear and panic among communities, and spreads misconceptions and rumors that
                            affect people’s ability to appropriately respond to the emergency.
                            Our Center designs strategies that are crucial to addressing the behavioral and social
                            aspects
                            of health risks that precede and follow an emergency, and as such need to be integrated into
                            the
                            response agenda from the outset. It is critical to ensure that communication efforts are
                            harmonized, relevant, timely, financially supported and aligned among all of the
                            preparedness
                            technical teams. A strong and united voice heard through various sources can determine
                            whether
                            an emergency spirals out of control or is brought into check as soon as possible.

                    <h4>Food security and improved Nutrition</h4>
                    <div class="focus-content">
                        <p>Households that are vulnerable to food insecurity often demonstrate poor nutrition outcomes.
                            Women and children are at greater risk of malnutrition than men: twice as many women suffer
                            from malnutrition as men, and girls are more likely to die from malnutrition than boys
                            (FAO). Nutrition is one of the critical drivers for economic growth and poverty reduction,
                            making it a key component of promoting international stability and security. Although
                            progress has been made over the past two decades in reducing micronutrient deficiency,
                            progress regarding other indicators related to malnutrition and food security (e.g., anemia,
                            wasting, stunting) remains to be seen. To tackle this complex problem sustainably, the
                            approach must be gender-sensitive to utilize social and behavior change strategies to
                            transform community norms.

                    <div class="focus-content">
                        <p>Choices made when a person is young may develop into repeated habits that continue into
                            adulthood. These include both healthy and unhealthy behaviors. Globally, nearly two-thirds
                            of premature deaths are associated with behaviors and conditions that began in young age.
                            For example, tobacco use and poor eating and exercise habits can lead to illness or
                            premature death later in life. In view of the many changes that take place during youth and
                            adolescence, it is essential to ensure a healthy, safe environment for youth that supports
                            their positive development. Youth must be given the support they need to make healthy
                            choices so they can lead healthy and successful lives in the future.
                            Social and Behavior Change strategies are important in encouraging information
                            dissemination, values reflection and behavior change around unsafe reproductive practices;
                            unhealthy lifestyles such as smoking, unhealthy dietary habits, early child marriages, get

                            majority of public health challenges experienced globally. The 21st century has experienced
                            several infectious disease outbreaks and pandemics such as Ebola virus disease, and now the
                            coronavirus disease. The COVID-19 pandemic has reiterated the need for multidimensional
                            approaches in fighting pandemics, including the integration of social science into emergency
                            risk communication.<br>
                            Uganda's tropical climate, population density, and poor socioeconomic indicators place the
                            country at risk of annual disease outbreaks. In the last several years, Uganda has
                            experienced outbreaks of cholera and other infectious diseases. These outbreaks have
                            highlighted the critical need for risk communication as an integral component of outbreak
                            response.<br />
                            The goal of social and behavior change interventions in pandemic preparedness and response
                            is to reduce morbidity and mortality by preventing transmission among those who are well and
                            those caring for the sick and by preventing further transmission of the disease among those
                            who are sick.
